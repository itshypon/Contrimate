#Contrimate

Contrimate is a web based platform which help newbies get into Open Source. It provides them a platform to find beginner-friendly issues according to their skills.

"Let's commit it !" It sounds good but it is also hard to find a good beginner friendly issue for a person who just signed up on Github and want to start his Open Source journey. We provide them issues based on language, its number of stars and how recently it was created. It saves alot of time for users to go to Github and manually search through labels like 'hacktoberfest', 'good-first-issues', 'beginner-friendly' etc., also saving them from wasting time in some non-active repositories. 
It also provides feature like profile rewards, leaderboard and chat platform where users can talk with repo maintainers to solved their doubts. Chat platform is only provided after connecting account with Github so that user profile will be created and they can contact maintainers who post manual issues through our platform. 
Having leaderboard and reward system or gamification keep users motivated, it will make them compete for seasonal Open Source contests and also helping them to grow in Open Source.
It is different from websites like quine.sh because we added gamification to retain users and a chat or communication platform so that users contact with maintainers directly to get help.
